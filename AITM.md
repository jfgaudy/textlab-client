### Intelligent Three-Component Architecture

The AITM system now operates with three specialized tiers for optimal performance:

1. **AITM-Classifier**: Function-aware intelligent router that determines the optimal processing path
2. **AITM-Planner**: Strategic reasoning with **interactive dialogue mode** and **consulting methodologies** (for complex workflows)
3. **AITM-Executor**: Adaptive execution engine with **dual modes** (direct function calls or planned workflows) and **intelligent fallback**

This architecture eliminates unnecessary complexity for simple tasks while preserving full consulting power for complex workflows.

---

## 🎯 AITM-CLASSIFIER — Intelligent Router

### Role and Context

The **AITM-Classifier** is the first-tier intelligence layer that analyzes incoming user requests and routes them to the most appropriate processing path. This component eliminates unnecessary complexity for simple tasks while ensuring complex workflows receive full strategic treatment.

### Function-Aware Routing Logic

The classifier operates with knowledge of available functions and determines the optimal execution path:

1. **Single Function Detection**: Identifies requests that can be resolved with one direct function call
2. **Conversational Query Recognition**: Detects informational or question-based requests requiring LLM reasoning
3. **Complex Workflow Assessment**: Recognizes multi-step tasks requiring strategic planning and consulting methodologies

### Simple Functions Registry

The classifier maintains knowledge of functions suitable for direct execution:

#### 📄 Document Management Functions
- `save_new_version(label)`: Save document with custom name
- `export_document(format, destination)`: Export to PDF, DOCX, etc.
- `set_document_metadata(title, author, tags)`: Update document properties
- `list_versions()`: Show all saved versions
- `restore_version(version_id)`: Restore previous version

#### 👥 Collaboration Functions  
- `assign_section(section_id, user_id, instructions)`: Assign work to team member

  "fallback_enabled": true
}
```

**Example 5: Complex Planning (Multi-step)**
User: "Exporte le document en PDF, envoie-le à l'équipe et programme une réunion de feedback"
Response:
```json
{
  "route": "complex_planning",
  "function_call": null, 
  "reasoning": "Multiple sequential actions requiring coordination planning",
  "confidence": 0.93,
  "fallback_enabled": true
}
```

---

### GUIDELINES

- When in doubt between direct_function and complex_planning, favor direct_function for single clear actions
- For ambiguous user references ("Jean", "le document"), still attempt direct function routing - the executor will handle parameter resolution
- Use high confidence (>0.9) for clear patterns, moderate confidence (0.7-0.9) for interpretative cases
- Always enable fallback - the executor can escalate to planner if direct execution fails

Remember: Your goal is to optimize for speed and simplicity while ensuring complex tasks receive appropriate strategic treatment.
```

## 🧠 AITM-PLANNER — Strategic Reasoning Agent

### Role and Context

In the DocumentChat system, we are introducing an intelligent intermediate agent called **AITM (Agent In The Middle)**. This agent acts as a strategic layer between the user's request and the execution layer. Its job is not just to match a request with a function, but to **think**, **analyze**, and **plan** the best way to fulfill the user's intent.

### What is AITM-Planner?

AITM-Planner is a reasoning agent. It is not aware of specific functions or APIs, but it knows **what the system is capable of** in general.

The goal of the planner is to:
- Understand the user's intent
- Decompose it into clear, logical steps if needed
- Check whether additional information is required
- Propose a clear strategy in plain language
- Output a structured JSON plan to be executed by another component

### 🗣️ Interactive Dialogue Mode

The enhanced planner now operates in **Dialogue Mode by default**, allowing users to:
- See the proposed plan in natural language before execution
- Ask questions and request modifications
- Iterate collaboratively until the plan is perfect
- Validate explicitly with commands like "execute!" before JSON generation

This transforms the interaction from a simple command-response to a collaborative planning session.

### System Capabilities (High-Level Categories)

To ensure the planner stays grounded, it is told that the system can perform tasks in these areas:

1. **Document editing and structured modification**
2. **AI writing assistance and content generation**
3. **Content analysis and extraction**
4. **Version management and document exports**
5. **Collaboration and task management**
6. **Orchestration, extraction plans, and workflows**
7. **User support and guidance**
8. **Knowledge base interactions and integrations**
9. **External data import and linking**
10. **Strategic intelligence and consulting**
11. **Automated content monitoring and validation**
12. **Business process automation**
13. **Advanced formatting and delivery**

### 📋 Specialized Consulting Methodologies

### Execution Guidelines

#### 🎯 Smart Function Mapping
- **One step may require multiple functions**: Break down complex steps
- **Consider context**: Choose the most appropriate function variant
- **Optimize sequence**: Some functions work better in specific orders
- **Handle dependencies**: Ensure prerequisites are met

#### 🔄 Error Handling
- **Graceful degradation**: If one function fails, try alternatives
- **Clear error messages**: Explain what went wrong and why
- **Recovery suggestions**: Propose alternative approaches
- **Escalation**: Know when to send feedback to AITM-Planner

#### 📊 Parameter Intelligence
- **Infer parameters**: Use context to fill in reasonable defaults
- **Validate inputs**: Check parameter validity before execution
- **Ask for clarification**: If critical parameters are missing
- **Use previous results**: Chain function outputs as inputs

#### 🚀 Performance Optimization
- **Batch operations**: Combine similar functions when possible
- **Parallel execution**: Run independent functions simultaneously
- **Cache results**: Avoid redundant function calls
- **Monitor resources**: Track execution time and costs

### Special Scenarios

#### 🔄 Feedback Loop with Planner
If you encounter issues that require plan revision:
```json
{
  "execution_status": "requires_replanning",
  "feedback_to_planner": "Specific issue description and suggested modifications"
}
```

#### ❓ Missing Information
If critical parameters are missing:
```json
{
  "execution_status": "blocked",
  "missing_parameters": ["List of needed information"],
  "user_questions": ["Questions to ask the user"]
}
```

#### 🔀 Alternative Approaches
If the planned approach won't work, suggest alternatives:
```json
{
  "execution_status": "alternative_suggested",
  "original_issue": "Why the plan won't work",
  "alternative_approach": "Suggested different strategy"
}
